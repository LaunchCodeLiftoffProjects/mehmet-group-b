        <p>My name is Lancaster Graham, I'm a junior developer and have been
            working on programs for the last 3 years. I have passion for
            programming and enjoy creating programs out of ideas. In my corner
            my wife and two kids cheer me on, as I tackle assignments left and
            right. I dream of combining programming and machinery to make
            functional programs that help or assist people in their everyday
            life.
